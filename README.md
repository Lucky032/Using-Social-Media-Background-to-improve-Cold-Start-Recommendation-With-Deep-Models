Major project.
The project is developed by Django Web Framework.
The project is divided into two parts:
1. E-commerce
2. Social media platform
The main theme of this project is: "If a user has to create an e-commerce account, the e-commerce account can't have enough data of that user, so the e-commerce platform can't recommend any products to that customer. This is the cold start problem. By this cold start problem, we have developed to connect the social media platform by O authorization server." 
In an e-commerce platform, we can create a profile and have to buy products.
On social media platforms like Instagram, we have to create profiles. We send reSoquests to our friends, like posts, comment, and so on.
So when we comment on any post (like an Apple Watch for our friend), the Apple Watch will recommend in e-commerce platforms with us.
